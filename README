// Wordpress Plugin Framework //
// Version 1.0.0 //

/ Description /
This is a basic framework / template designed for use with Wordpress (http://wordpress.org/) installations.
The ultimate goal is to provide a starting point for web developers when it comes to creating new plugins.


/ Included features /
Some of the basic, included features (f = frontend, b = backend):
  - functions for including stylesheets; f,b
  - functions for including script files [.js files]; f,b
  - jQuery library, including plugins:
    - jQueryUI
    - uploadify
    - datepicker
    - timepicker


/ To-Do (a list to myself) /
  - Fix plugin description

/ Long-Term Plans /

  - modifying the way scripts operate, particularly jQuery.  Most of the jQuery features do not need to be loaded on the
      frontend, so loading those on the frontend is in fact a waste of space and time.  Also, make it more of a
      'plug-and-play' system, perhaps with on/off switches or simple pre-defined constants
  - adjusting the stylesheet system in a similar 'plug-and-play' fashion
  - incorporate a template for submenus
